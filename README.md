etch sketch project

- create 16x16 grid of square divs
  - create using js
  - put grid squares inside another container div
  - use flexbox to make divs appear as grid
  - careful with borders and margins
- setup 'hover' effects so grid divs change colors when your mouse passes over them, leaving pixelated trail
  -addEventListeners
  - add new classes or change divs background color using js
- add button on top of the screen that will send user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid
  - existing grid should be removed and new grid generated in the same space (960px wide).  Set max to 100 input
  - research button tags in HTML and how to make js fuction run when one is clicked
  - check out 'prompts'
- extra credit: randomise colours, darkening effect, each interaction adds 10% more color
